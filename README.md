# rust-korean-trifling
a collection of weird stuff that mess with modern korean alphabets.

most of these were created when i was an avid contributor to korean uncyclepedia
(백괴사전) back in 2005-ish timeframe; at that time these were written in php for
use in a wikipedia extension i also wrote specifically for korean uncyclopedia.
